# Rulers

This is my implementation of the "Rulers" framework, which I'm doing as part of working through [Noah Gibbs'](https://github.com/noahgibbs) book [Rebuilding Rails](https://rebuilding-rails.com/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rulers'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run:

```
gem build rulers.gemspec
gem install rulers-0.0.1.gem
```
